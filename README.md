NULS is a blockchain with many years of technical experience and has been steadily developing for years. Since the NULS community announced the launch of ENULS, a blockchain compatible with EVM, we have been excited about the ease of creating an ecosystem project and contributing to the community and the NULS ecosystem project.
PheasantSwap is a decentralized AMM trading platform based on ENULS, which can achieve fast, low-cost, efficient, infinitely scalable, and decentralized trading through NULS parallel chains and cross-chain technology solutions. Through NULS and NerveNetwork cross-chain network, dozens of blockchain tokens can be transferred to ENULS, where we provide near-zero Gas fees, reducing the threshold for ordinary users to enter the blockchain and Web3 world.
